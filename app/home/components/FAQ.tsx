  {
    question: "How are your rates so much lower?",
    answer: "You only pay for what you use. No bloated bundles, no \"one-size-fits-all\" rates. Add or remove payment methods anytime — your pricing adjusts automatically."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can we go live?",
    answer: "Depends how fast you move. If your docs are ready and your devs know what they're doing, we've seen merchants live in under a week. Two if things get messy."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with my industry?",
    answer: "If you're licensed and compliant — probably yes. We specialize in iGaming, Forex, and Adult, but we've onboarded everything from dating platforms to crypto brokerages."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to switch everything at once?",
    answer: "Hell no. Start with 20% of your volume as a test. See the difference. Then decide if you want to move more. Smart merchants always have backup processors anyway."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does approval actually take?",
    answer: "About 48 hours for qualification, then up to a week for integration and testing. We move fast, but never at the cost of compliance."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer: "A valid license, clean compliance record, and traffic that doesn't suck. That's it. If you've got those, we can move fast."
